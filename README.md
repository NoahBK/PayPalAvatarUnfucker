The above image is the default. Why they have a green background with a mostly blue/white UI, I will never understand. Nevertheless, my autistic ass was tired of looking at it and decided to fix it via code fuckery. That's why this repo now exists. 

It works on any browser that supports user script extensions, such as [Violentmonkey](https://violentmonkey.github.io/).
